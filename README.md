### Enhancing Monorepo Workflows with GitHub Actions

The concept of a **monorepo** presents a unified way to manage related projects within a single repository. By centralizing multiple applications and shared libraries, teams can enhance collaboration, streamline development, and maintain consistency. However, while integrating Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes within a monorepo can optimize your development pipeline, it also introduces challenges, particularly regarding conflict resolution and scaling.

To address these challenges, it's essential to consider structuring your CI/CD workflows thoughtfully. A well-organized monorepo can support automated testing and deployment across all projects while minimizing conflicts between teams.

Below is a glimpse of our monorepo structure:

```
.
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       ├── camera_app.yml
│       └── zoom_lib.yml
├── apps
│   ├── camera_app
│   │   ├── main.py
│   │   └── test_main.py
│   └── image_compressor_app
├── libs
│   ├── cross_platform_lib
│   └── zoom_lib
│       ├── main.py
│       └── test_main.py
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```
